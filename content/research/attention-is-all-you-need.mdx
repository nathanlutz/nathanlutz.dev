# Introduction

This paper introduced the Transformer architecture, which revolutionized NLP and became the foundation for modern large language models like GPT and BERT.

## Key Contributions

The paper made three major contributions:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism** - Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when processing each word
2. **Positional Encoding** - Adds information about word position since the architecture doesn't have inherent order awareness
3. **Multi-Head Attention** - Uses multiple attention mechanisms in parallel to capture different types of relationships

## Why It Matters

Before transformers, RNNs and LSTMs were the standard for sequence modeling. These architectures processed text sequentially, which was slow and struggled with long-range dependencies.

Transformers changed everything by:
- Processing all words in parallel (much faster training)
- Capturing long-range dependencies more effectively
- Scaling better with more data and compute

## Practical Example

Imagine the sentence: "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired."

The word "it" could refer to either "animal" or "street". The self-attention mechanism allows the model to learn that "it" most likely refers to "animal" by looking at all the words in context simultaneously.

## Impact

This architecture became the foundation for:
- GPT series (text generation)
- BERT (text understanding)
- Vision Transformers (image processing)
- Many other domains beyond NLP

The paper literally transformed the field, making "attention" the primary mechanism in modern AI systems.
